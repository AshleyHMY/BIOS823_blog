    "Explanation for Q1:\n",
    "In this question I want to find the 10001st prime number let n = 10001. I created a list called prime_numbers that includes the first two prime number 2 and 3. In the first if statement when n=1 the first prime number is 2 and n=2 the second prime number is 3. I added more elements(prime numbers) to the prime_numbers list. Then I want to check if integers greater than 3 is a prime. First let i=4 and I want to check if 4 is a prime using the for loop (for j in range(2, 3). Here I used int(i/2)+1 to reduce calculation (eg, 10=2x5, if 10 can be divded by 2, we can conclude 10 is not a prime, do not need to check if 10 can be divided by 5 again). If 4 can be divided by 2 or 3, flag will be equal to True and 4 will not be added to the prime_numbers list. Then let i=5 and run the for loop (for j in range(2, 3)). 5 cannot be divided by 2 or 3, thus, 5 is a prime number and 5 is the third element in the prime_numbers list. The code will print \"3th prime number is 5. let n=10001, the code will give the 10001th prime number. "

The prime_sum_lst includes elements (eg, 2,5,17,41). Use the mac() function to select the largest element in prime_sum_lst list.
